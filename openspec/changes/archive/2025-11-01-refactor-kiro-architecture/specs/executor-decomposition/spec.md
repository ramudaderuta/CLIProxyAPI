# Kiro Executor Decomposition

## Purpose
Decompose the monolithic Kiro executor (1,115+ lines) into focused, testable components following single responsibility principle.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Focused Core Executor
The system SHALL provide a streamlined core executor focused solely on request coordination and response handling.

#### Scenario: Request orchestration
- **WHEN** Kiro requests are received
- **THEN** the core executor SHALL coordinate authentication, translation, and API communication
- **AND** the executor SHALL delegate specific tasks to appropriate specialized components
- **AND** the executor SHALL maintain request lifecycle management without handling implementation details

#### Scenario: Error coordination
- **WHEN** errors occur during request processing
- **THEN** the core executor SHALL coordinate error responses across all components
- **AND** the executor SHALL provide consistent error formatting and logging
- **AND** the executor SHALL implement appropriate retry logic at the orchestration level

### Requirement: Dedicated Kiro HTTP Client
The system SHALL provide a dedicated HTTP client component for Kiro API communication.

#### Scenario: API communication
- **WHEN** making requests to Kiro services
- **THEN** the HTTP client SHALL handle all Kiro-specific protocol details
- **AND** the client SHALL manage request signing, region routing, and endpoint resolution
- **AND** the client SHALL implement proper error handling and retry strategies

#### Scenario: Token integration
- **WHEN** authenticating with Kiro services
- **THEN** the HTTP client SHALL integrate with token management for authentication
- **AND** the client SHALL handle token refresh and re-authentication transparently
- **AND** the client SHALL manage session state and connection pooling

### Requirement: Component Testability
Each executor component SHALL be independently testable with clear interfaces and dependencies.

#### Scenario: Unit testing
- **WHEN** testing individual components
- **THEN** each component SHALL have mockable dependencies and clear interfaces
- **AND** components SHALL be testable in isolation without requiring full request flows
- **AND** tests SHALL validate component-specific behavior and edge cases

#### Scenario: Integration testing
- **WHEN** testing component interactions
- **THEN** integration tests SHALL validate component coordination and data flow
- **AND** tests SHALL use realistic mocks for external dependencies
- **AND** tests SHALL cover error propagation and recovery scenarios

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Kiro Request Processing
The system SHALL process Kiro requests through coordinated components rather than a monolithic executor.

#### Scenario: Component coordination
- **WHEN** processing Kiro requests
- **THEN** the core executor SHALL coordinate translation, client, and authentication components
- **AND** each component SHALL handle its specific responsibility independently
- **AND** the system SHALL maintain the same external API behavior

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Monolithic Executor Implementation
The system SHALL NOT implement all Kiro processing logic within a single large executor component.

#### Scenario: Separation of concerns
- **WHEN** implementing Kiro request processing
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT mix authentication, translation, and HTTP communication in one component
- **AND** each concern SHALL be implemented in focused, single-purpose components
